# Premium Prediction Model

## Overview

The **Premium Prediction Model** is a machine learning project designed to analyze and predict insurance premiums based on customer data. It aims to provide actionable insights and enhance decision-making in the insurance industry.

## Problem Statement

Predicting insurance premiums is influenced by multiple factors such as age, income, and claim history. This project aims to:
- Deliver accurate premium predictions.
- Identify key variables affecting premiums.
- Visualize results to support business decisions.

---

## Data Collection

The dataset includes:
- **Age**: Age of the policyholder.
- **Gender**: Male or Female.
- **BMI**: Body Mass Index of the policyholder.
- **Children**: Number of children/dependents covered by the policy.
- **Smoker**: Whether the policyholder is a smoker (Yes/No).
- **Charges**: Medical charges incurred by the policyholder.

## Data Analysis

Analysis includes:
- **Preprocessing**: Data cleaning and transformation.
- **Exploratory Analysis**: Identifying trends and patterns.
- **Feature Engineering**: Enhancing predictive model performance.

---

## Data Visualization

Visualization highlights include:
- **Premium Charges by Age**: Line graph showing premium variations by age.
- **Premium Charges by Gender**: Line graph showing premium variations by age.
- **Premium Charges by Chilred**: Line graph showing premium variations by age.
-  **Premium Charges by BMI**: Line graph showing premium variations by age.

## Tools and Technologies

- **Python**: Core language for analysis and modeling.
  - **Pandas**: Data manipulation.
  - **NumPy**: Numerical computations.
  - **Matplotlib & Seaborn**: Data visualization.
  - **Shap**: For model Interpretatiom
- **Jupyter Notebooks**: Documenting workflows.

## SHAP Values

SHAP (SHapley Additive exPlanations) values were used to interpret the model's predictions and identify the most important features contributing to premium predictions. SHAP provides a way to explain individual predictions and visualize feature importance.
